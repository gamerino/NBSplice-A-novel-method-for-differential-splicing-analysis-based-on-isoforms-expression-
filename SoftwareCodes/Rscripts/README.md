This file provides the analysis steps performed to analyze differential splicing on R and compare the obtained results.

1- `ExpressionMatricesPreparation.R`: Preparing expression matrices at the isoform level and all information need to perform differential splicing analysis.

2-	`DSAnalysisNBSplice.R`: Performing differential splicing analysis with nine setups of NBSplice. Obtaining performance results at the gene level.

3-	`NBSplicePerformanceAtIsoLevel.R`: Obtaining the performance results at the transcript level for the nine setups of NBSplice.

4-	`NBSplicePerformanceSimulatedGroups.R`: Obtaining the performance results for each simulated group and subgroup.

5-	`DSAnalysisRPackages.R`: Performing differential splicing analysis with NBSplice, DEXSeq and DRIMSeq.

6-	`ResultsAnalysisAndComparison.R`: Analyzing and comparing results
