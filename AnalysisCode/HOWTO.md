Analysis steps performed to evaluate differential splicing analysis with NBSplice and other three R packages.
Note that all scripts had definitions about files location that you need to change BEFORE their uses. 

The steps are 

1-  Analyze RNA-seq simualted data with NBSplice using the `NBSplice.R` script.

2-	Analyze RNA-seq simualted data with exon-count R packages using the `Alternative.R` script

3-  Comparison of differential splicing tools with the `DSComparison.R` script.
